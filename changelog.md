#### Important
 1) Clean Flash is Mandatory 
 2) Don't set **dark colors** when in **Light mode** or **light colors** while in **Dark mode** (in the QS/Notification background color picker in AtomicHub/Theme). Doing so will result in an abrupt restart. While editing the hex color/ choosing the colors for Quick Settings / Notification Background color ( Settings -> AtomicHub -> Themes), donâ€™t select Dark colors when in Light mode or Light colors while in Dark mode. Not abiding by this would reboot the OS without any warning.
 3) Use forums to report bugs with logs.
